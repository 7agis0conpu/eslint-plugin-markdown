```txt
Don't lint me!
```

This is some code:

```js
console.log(42);
```

```JavaScript
// Comment
function foo() {
    console.log("Hello");
}
```

```node
console.log(process.version);
```

How about some JSX?

```jsx
console.log("Error!");
```

    I may be a code block, but don't lint me!

The end.
