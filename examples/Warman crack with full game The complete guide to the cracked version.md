It allows you to create and modify geometry models easily with Ansys SpaceClaim technology, which is a direct modeling tool that eliminates the need for complex CAD operations. It also enables you to perform thermal, structural and fluids simulations in real time with completely meshless and interactive solvers. With Ansys Discovery Student, you can explore and understand physics concepts without spending a lot of time learning how to use a complicated simulation tool.
  
Ansys Discovery Student is ideal for students who want to learn about product design and engineering in a fun and intuitive way. You can experiment with different design scenarios and see how they affect the performance and behavior of your product. You can also compare different physics phenomena and discover how they interact with each other. For example, you can see how heat transfer affects the stress and deformation of a metal part, or how fluid flow affects the aerodynamics and lift of a wing.
