Measures of variation are statistics that describe how much data values vary or spread out in a data set. Some common measures of variation are range, interquartile range, standard deviation, and variance. In this article, we will show you how to use these measures of variation to check your homework answers for lesson 3.

Lesson 3 covers topics such as mean absolute deviation, z-scores, and percentiles. These topics are related to measures of variation because they help us compare data values to the mean or median of a data set. For example, mean absolute deviation tells us the average distance of data values from the mean, z-scores tell us how many standard deviations a data value is from the mean, and percentiles tell us what percentage of data values are below or equal to a given value.
 
To check your homework answers for lesson 3, you can use the following steps:
 
1. Calculate the measure of variation for the data set given in the question. You can use a calculator or a spreadsheet program to help you with this step.
2. Compare your answer with the answer key provided by your teacher or textbook. If your answer matches the answer key, you are done. If not, go to the next step.
3. Identify the source of error in your calculation. You may have made a mistake in entering the data values, applying the formula, rounding the result, or interpreting the question. Try to correct your error and recalculate the measure of variation.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until your answer matches the answer key or you are confident that your answer is correct.

Using measures of variation to check your homework answers can help you improve your understanding of the concepts and avoid losing points for careless mistakes. It can also help you prepare for quizzes and tests by reviewing the material and practicing your skills. We hope this article was helpful and wish you good luck with lesson 3!
  
Now that you know how to use measures of variation to check your homework answers, let's look at some examples of lesson 3 questions and how to solve them.
 
## Example 1
 
The table below shows the heights (in inches) of 10 students in a class. Find the mean absolute deviation of the heights.

| Student | Height |
| --- | --- |

| A | 64 |

| B | 66 |

| C | 68 |

| D | 70 |

| E | 72 |

| F | 74 |

| G | 76 |

| H | 78 |

| I | 80 |

| J | 82 |

Solution:

1. To find the mean absolute deviation, we first need to find the mean of the heights. The mean is the sum of the data values divided by the number of data values. In this case, the sum of the heights is 730 and the number of heights is 10. So, the mean is 730/10 = 73.
2. Next, we need to find the absolute deviations of each height from the mean. The absolute deviation is the distance of a data value from the mean, ignoring the sign. For example, the absolute deviation of student A's height from the mean is |64 - 73| = 9. We can use a table to organize our calculations.

    | Student | Height | Absolute Deviation |
    | --- | --- | --- |

    | A | 64 | 9 |

    | B | 66 | 7 |

    | C | 68 | 5 |

    | D | 70 | 3 |

    | E | 72 |< 1 |
