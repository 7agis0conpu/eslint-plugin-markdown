# Moi 3D: A CAD Software for Designers and Artists
 
Moi 3D is a CAD software that stands for Moment of Inspiration. It is designed for designers and artists who want to create smooth and organic shapes with NURBS modeling. NURBS stands for Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines, which are mathematical curves and surfaces that can represent any shape with high accuracy and flexibility.

Moi 3D has a sleek and intuitive user interface that operates seamlessly with a pen tablet. It also has a fast and fluid workflow that makes it easy to use for beginners and professionals alike. It offers a blend of precision and freeform drawing tools, as well as powerful boolean functions, filleting, lofting, sweeping, and other advanced features.
 
One of the unique features of Moi 3D is its polygon mesh export feature that generates clean and crisp N-Gon meshes from NURBS models. N-Gons are polygons with more than four sides, which can be useful for rendering or further editing in other software. Moi 3D can export meshes in various formats, such as OBJ, FBX, STL, IGES, STEP, and more.
 
Moi 3D is not a free software. It costs $295 USD for a single license. However, users can download a trial version from the official website and try it out for 30 days. Users can also find various resources online, such as tutorials, videos, forums, scripts, plugins, and language packs.
