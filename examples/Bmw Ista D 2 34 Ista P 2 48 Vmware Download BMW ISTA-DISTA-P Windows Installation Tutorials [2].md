# How to Install BMW ISTA/D and ISTA/P on VMware with ICOM Emulator
 
If you want to diagnose and program your BMW cars from 1994 to 2013, including the new F series, you will need the BMW ISTA/D and ISTA/P software. ISTA/D is used for diagnostics and technical documents, while ISTA/P is used for coding and programming. However, installing these software on your Windows laptop can be tricky and time-consuming. That's why some people prefer to use VMware, a virtual machine software that allows you to run multiple operating systems on one computer.
 
In this article, we will show you how to install BMW ISTA/D 2.34 and ISTA/P 2.48 on VMware with ICOM Emulator, a software that simulates the functions of a genuine ICOM unit. You will also need a K+DCAN cable or an ENET cable to connect your laptop with your car. Alternatively, you can use other compatible cables such as EDIC, OPS, or K+D+CAN.

## Step 2: Install VMware Workstation Player
 
After downloading the files, you will need to install VMware Workstation Player on your Windows laptop. This software will allow you to run the virtual machines that contain the BMW ISTA software.
 
To install VMware Workstation Player, follow these steps:

1. Run the setup file and follow the instructions.
2. Accept the license agreement and choose a destination folder.
3. Select the components you want to install and click Next.
4. Choose whether you want to check for updates automatically or not.
5. Choose whether you want to join the VMware customer experience program or not.
6. Click Install and wait for the installation to finish.
7. Click Finish and restart your computer if prompted.

## Step 3: Import the vmware images
 
After installing VMware Workstation Player, you will need to import the vmware images that contain the BMW ISTA software. These are compressed files that you will need to extract first.
 
To import the vmware images, follow these steps:

1. Extract the BMW ISTA/D 2.34 and ISTA/P 2.48 vmware images using a software like WinRAR or 7-Zip.
2. Open VMware Workstation Player and click Open a Virtual Machine.
3. Browse to the folder where you extracted the vmware images and select the file with the .vmx extension.
4. Click Import and wait for the process to complete.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 for the other vmware image.

## Step 4: Configure the virtual machines
 
After importing the vmware images, you will need to configure some settings for the virtual machines to work properly.
 
To configure the virtual machines, follow these steps:

1. Select one of the virtual machines in VMware Workstation Player and click Edit virtual machine settings.
2. In the Hardware tab, select Network Adapter and choose Bridged: Connected directly to the physical network.
3. In the Options tab, select Shared Folders and uncheck Always enabled.
4. Click OK and repeat steps 1-3 for the other virtual machine.
